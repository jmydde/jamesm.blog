      <description>Overview Tesla Optimus, also known as the Tesla Bot, is a bipedal humanoid robot which has been under development by Tesla since 2021. It&amp;rsquo;s designed to be a general-purpose robot, meaning it could potentially be used for a wide range of tasks. It&amp;rsquo;s equipped with Tesla-designed AI for navigation &amp;amp; understanding surroundings. The latest version (Optimus Gen 2) boasts faster walking, lighter weight &amp;amp; improved dexterity.
Elon Musk envisions a future where Optimus can take on dangerous or unpleasant jobs, freeing humans for more creative or leisure pursuits.</description>

<p><a href="https://www.tesla.com/en_gb/AI">Tesla</a> Optimus, also known as the Tesla Bot, is a bipedal humanoid robot which has been under development by Tesla since 2021. It&rsquo;s designed to be a general-purpose robot, meaning it could potentially be used for a wide range of tasks.  It&rsquo;s equipped with Tesla-designed AI for navigation &amp; understanding surroundings.  The latest version (Optimus Gen 2) boasts faster walking, lighter weight &amp; improved dexterity.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk">Elon Musk</a> envisions a future where Optimus can take on dangerous or unpleasant jobs, freeing humans for more creative or leisure pursuits. There&rsquo;s even speculation that Optimus could be available for purchase within the next few years, potentially revolutionizing how we work and live.</p>
<p>The goal is for Optimus to be <strong>less than half the cost of a Tesla car</strong>;</p>
<ul>
<li>this translates to roughly $20,000 to $25,000 based on current Tesla car prices</li>
<li>the price could eventually fall even lower as production scales up</li>
</ul>
<p>Musk has predicted long-term their robot will probably be worth <strong>significantly more</strong> than the car side of their business.</p>

      <description>Boston Dynamics has revealed it&amp;rsquo;s most astonishing humanoid robot so far.
The All New Atlas is Boston Dynamic&amp;rsquo;s first all-electric humanoid robot, designed for real-world applications, it has a far more human-like body. However it&amp;rsquo;s still a long way from commercial or consumer availability.
The next generation of the Atlas program builds on decades of research and furthers their commitment to delivering the most capable, useful mobile robots. An advanced control system and state-of-the-art hardware give the robot the power and balance to demonstrate advanced athletics and agility.</description>

      <description>About OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s Voice Engine is a text-to-speech tool which can create realistic voices from just a 15-second audio sample. It is notable that a small model with a single 15-second sample can create emotive and realistic voices. To ensure responsible use testers must get clear consent from voice providers, avoid creating user-generated voices, and inform listeners that the voices are AI-generated.

<p>Google Gemini Ultra is the top-of-the-line offering within the Gemini family of large language models, developed by Google DeepMind [1]. It stands out for its superior capabilities compared to the base Gemini and the advanced version [2]. Here&rsquo;s what makes it special:</p>
<p><strong>Unmatched Performance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>State-of-the-Art: Outperforms previous models on various benchmarks, including tasks related to text, code, and more [3].</li>
<li>MMLU Champion: Achieves a score of 90.0% on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark, surpassing human experts for the first time [2]. MMLU tests a broad range of subjects, demanding both knowledge and problem-solving skills.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advanced Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While specific details about its functionalities are likely still under development, we can expect it to possess all the strengths of Gemini Advanced, including:
<ul>
<li>Multimodal reasoning for analyzing combined text and visual information.</li>
<li>Expertise in coding, understanding, explaining, and generating code across various languages.</li>
<li>Enhanced creative capabilities to brainstorm ideas and craft diverse digital content formats.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On top of these, Gemini Ultra might offer even more advanced features that haven&rsquo;t been publicly revealed yet.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Availability</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike the base Gemini and the mobile-accessible Gemini Advanced (part of Google One AI Premium), Gemini Ultra is likely not widely available yet. It might be in a limited access or beta phase initially [4, 6].</li>
</ul>
<p>Google Gemini Ultra is a cutting-edge AI model pushing the boundaries of language understanding and generation. Its capabilities are expected to be significant for various fields,  but its accessibility might be limited for now.</p>
