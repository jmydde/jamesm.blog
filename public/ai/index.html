  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    
      <p>Overview Wow, crazy times, the best technology in the world is now becoming incredibly cheap and accessible to everyone! 🤯
DeepSeek’s AI chatbot has become the top free app on Apple’s store since its January launch. This rapid success, fuelled by DeepSeek’s cost-effectiveness compared to US competitors, has sent shockwaves through financial markets.
Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen has lauded DeepSeek’s AI as a “groundbreaking achievement”, while the company claims it’s models rival industry leaders like ChatGPT at a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek reportedly invested only $6 million in its development, a stark contrast to the billions spent by US AI companies.

    <h2>Geoffrey Hinton
    </h2>
  </header>
  <section class="entry-content">
    
      <p>
About Geoffrey Hinton is a big name in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly when it comes to artificial neural networks. He’s a British-Canadian computer scientist and cognitive psychologist who’s achieved some major milestones:
Pioneering Deep Learning: Hinton’s research helped lay the groundwork for the resurgence of deep learning, a powerful technique that enables computers to learn from vast amounts of data. This has led to advancements in areas like image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Backpropagation Advocate: He was instrumental in reviving the idea of backpropagation, a learning algorithm that allows neural networks to adjust and improve their performance. Academia and Industry: Hinton spent time at both the University of Toronto and Google (until 2023), where he co-founded the Vector Institute in Toronto and worked on Google Brain, a deep learning research team. Awards and Recognition: His contributions have been widely recognized. He’s a recipient of the prestigious Turing Award, often called the “Nobel Prize of computing,” among many other accolades.
