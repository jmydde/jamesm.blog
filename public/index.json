It boasts several improvements and new features designed to enhance the sound, control, and workflow for professional keyboardists.\nHere is a summary of the key aspects of the Yamaha Montage M\nThree Powerful Engines - Like its predecessor, Montage M features three sound engines: AN-X, AWM2, and FM-X. These engines offer a vast sonic palette, allowing you to create warm vintage analog tones, cutting-edge FM sounds, and ultra-realistic acoustic instruments. Increased Polyphony - A significant upgrade is the 400-note total polyphony, a jump from the original Montage\u0026rsquo;s 256 notes. This allows for more complex and layered sounds without worrying about dropped notes. New AN-X Virtual Analog Engine - This engine offers a fresh take on virtual analog synthesis, providing more detailed control over sound shaping. Improved User Interface - The Montage M features a redesigned user interface with new easy-edit pages and shortcuts, making sound creation and editing more intuitive and efficient. Additional Knobs and Encoders - More physical controls give you more immediate access to tweak parameters and add dynamics to your performance. VCM Rotary Speaker Effect - This new effect accurately emulates the classic sound of a Leslie speaker cabinet, adding warmth and movement to organ and electric piano sounds. Powerful USB Audio Interface - The Montage M functions as a 6-in/32-out USB audio interface, allowing you to record audio directly to your DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) for seamless integration into your studio workflow. The Montage M comes in three versions, each with a different keyboard action\nM6 - 61-key FSX synth action (ideal for portability and playing melodies). M7 - 76-key FSX synth action (a good balance between portability and playability for splits and layers). M8X - 88-key weighted hammer action with polyphonic aftertouch (perfect for pianists who need a realistic piano feel and expressive control). Overall, the Yamaha Montage M is a premium synthesizer workstation offering a powerful combination of sound quality, versatile sound engines, improved control options, and seamless studio integration.

Deep dive into AWS Cloud Development Kit The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is a multi-language, open-source framework that enables developers to harness the full power of familiar programming languages to define reusable cloud components and provision applications built from those components using AWS CloudFormation. In this session, you develop an AWS CDK application and learn how to quickly assemble AWS infrastructure. We explore the AWS Construct Library and show you how easy it is to configure your cloud resources, manage permissions, connect event sources, and build and publish your own constructs. Implementing DevSecOps pipelines with compliance in mind Review a DevSecOps CI/CD pipeline that includes software composition analysis, static application security testing, and dynamic application security testing. Also learn about best practices for incorporating security checkpoints across various pipeline stages and aggregating vulnerability findings into a single pane of glass. Finally, hear about processes and tools that can increase an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services in a secure manner. Multi-account and multi-Region deployments at scale Many AWS customers are implementing multi-account strategies in order to more easily manage their cloud infrastructure and improve their security and compliance posture. In this chalk talk, learn about various options for deploying resources into multiple accounts and AWS Regions including across partitions (as in AWS GovCloud [US]). The talk also covers how these options can align to your organizational units in AWS Control Tower. Kubernetes (EKS) Amazon EKS SaaS: Building a working multi-tenant environment Amazon EKS provides SaaS developers with a rich collection of constructs that can be used to create a SaaS solution. In this workshop, learn how to build a complete multi-tenant SaaS environment that highlights the different strategies and considerations that come with building, securing, and deploying SaaS applications in an Amazon EKS model. Work through labs that demonstrate the implementation of core multi-tenant concepts, including onboarding, tenant isolation, tiering, cost attribution, and data partitioning. Get hands-on experience with the moving parts of an Amazon EKS SaaS solution while discovering the nuances of the Amazon EKS SaaS model. Best practices for using Amazon EKS add-ons Kubernetes add-on software extends the functionality of Kubernetes and is typically built and maintained by the Kubernetes community, AWS, and other third-party vendors. Amazon EKS add-ons allow you to configure, deploy, and update the operational software or add-ons that provide key functionality to support your Kubernetes applications, including cluster networking, operational software for observability, management, scaling, and security. In this chalk talk, walk through best practices for using add-ons to consistently maintain the security and stability of your Amazon EKS clusters. Best practices platform teams can use to streamline Kubernetes operations Kubernetes accelerates the digital transformation of cloud-native applications. As organizations expand, the number of Kubernetes clusters and applications can lead to significant operational challenges. A popular choice for managed Kubernetes is Amazon EKS. It’s no wonder that platform teams are on a quest to better manage, scale, and secure their Amazon EKS clusters across disparate internal application teams while working with multiple AWS accounts in multiple AWS Regions. AWS Partner Rafay Systems helps hundreds of enterprises reduce the complexity of Kubernetes. In this lightning talk, learn best practices on streamlining Kubernetes from self-service cluster provisioning through to centralized policy management. Bootstrapping “batteries-included” Amazon EKS clusters In this builders’ session, learn about using Amazon EKS Blueprints for Terraform to configure and deploy “batteries-included” Amazon EKS clusters. Dive deep into EKS Blueprints code and learn to deploy security-compliant EKS clusters with managed node groups and AWS Fargate profiles. Learn how to build EKS clusters that support workloads from multiple teams with EKS Blueprint’s teams functionality. Lastly, learn how to easily deploy AWS managed add-ons (like VPC CNI, CoreDNS, and kube-proxy) in addition to popular open-source add-ons, including Metrics Server, cluster autoscaler, Prometheus, Karpenter, AWS Load Balancer Controller, Fluent Bit, and Argo CD. Build Kubernetes at scale using AWS file services Learn how you can launch and use Amazon FSx fully managed file services to power your Amazon EKS Kubernetes container workloads. Deploy a container-based workload with persistent storage from Amazon FSx to better understand the benefits and key features for container-based workloads. The workshop also touches on dimensions such as performance, scale, high availability, and how to create clones of your DevOps data in seconds, or replicate and access your data seamlessly across AWS Regions, to further power at-scale container-based workloads. Data analysis with Amazon EKS and AWS Batch Gain an understanding of the recently added AWS Batch support for managing and scheduling large-scale data analysis using Amazon EKS. Learn AWS Batch fundamental concepts and how AWS Batch works together with your other AWS services running within Amazon EKS. Deploy an Amazon EKS cluster, leverage AWS Batch to manage pods, and train a simple machine learning model. Disaster recovery, high availability, and resiliency on Amazon EKS Kubernetes application development and operations teams need to build resilient systems that embrace failure as a natural occurrence. Learn about patterns and strategies for running resilient Kubernetes clusters on AWS. Use chaos engineering tools to simulate failures and disaster scenarios for Kubernetes clusters on AWS and learn how to recover from them within given recovery time and recovery point objectives. Getting started with Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) Introduction to Kubernetes using the AWS managed Kubernetes service Amazon EKS. Previous experience with Kubernetes or container workflows is useful but not required. During this workshop you deploy everything needed to have a set of microservices running with additional useful day-2 functionality in place. The workshop includes deploying a set of microservices, configuring a load balancer in front of your service, configuring centralized logging, and enabling automatic scaling of your pods and worker nodes. How to monitor and reduce your compute costs As organizations adopt Amazon EKS to securely and reliably run their mission-critical workloads in the AWS cloud and on premises, it is essential that they have tools to monitor and optimize what they spend to run their Kubernetes applications. This builders’ session demonstrates cost-reduction steps in a sample architecture and then shows ways you can identify and reduce compute costs in your environment using OpenCost, Kubecost, Karpenter, and AWS Graviton. Join Adobe and AWS to learn how they are collaborating with Kubecost and the OpenCost community to standardize cost tracking, allocation, methodologies, and measurements and help teams using Kubernetes more easily understand their infrastructure costs. Running efficient Kubernetes clusters on Amazon EC2 with Karpenter Learn how to provision, manage, and maintain your Kubernetes clusters with Amazon EKS at virtually any scale using Karpenter. Karpenter is a node lifecycle management solution used to scale your Kubernetes cluster. It observes incoming pods and launches the right instances for the situation. Instance selection decisions are intent-based and driven by the specification of incoming pods, including resource requests and scheduling constraints. Simplifying Kubernetes application management with cdk8s The CDK for Kubernetes (cdk8s) is a new open-source software development framework that lets you define Kubernetes applications and resources using familiar programming languages.
