Implementing DevSecOps pipelines with compliance in mind Review a DevSecOps CI/CD pipeline that includes software composition analysis, static application security testing, and dynamic application security testing. Also learn about best practices for incorporating security checkpoints across various pipeline stages and aggregating vulnerability findings into a single pane of glass. Finally, hear about processes and tools that can increase an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services in a secure manner. Multi-account and multi-Region deployments at scale Many AWS customers are implementing multi-account strategies in order to more easily manage their cloud infrastructure and improve their security and compliance posture. In this chalk talk, learn about various options for deploying resources into multiple accounts and AWS Regions including across partitions (as in AWS GovCloud [US]). The talk also covers how these options can align to your organizational units in AWS Control Tower. Kubernetes (EKS) Amazon EKS SaaS: Building a working multi-tenant environment Amazon EKS provides SaaS developers with a rich collection of constructs that can be used to create a SaaS solution. In this workshop, learn how to build a complete multi-tenant SaaS environment that highlights the different strategies and considerations that come with building, securing, and deploying SaaS applications in an Amazon EKS model. Work through labs that demonstrate the implementation of core multi-tenant concepts, including onboarding, tenant isolation, tiering, cost attribution, and data partitioning. Get hands-on experience with the moving parts of an Amazon EKS SaaS solution while discovering the nuances of the Amazon EKS SaaS model. Best practices for using Amazon EKS add-ons Kubernetes add-on software extends the functionality of Kubernetes and is typically built and maintained by the Kubernetes community, AWS, and other third-party vendors. Amazon EKS add-ons allow you to configure, deploy, and update the operational software or add-ons that provide key functionality to support your Kubernetes applications, including cluster networking, operational software for observability, management, scaling, and security. In this chalk talk, walk through best practices for using add-ons to consistently maintain the security and stability of your Amazon EKS clusters. Best practices platform teams can use to streamline Kubernetes operations Kubernetes accelerates the digital transformation of cloud-native applications. As organizations expand, the number of Kubernetes clusters and applications can lead to significant operational challenges. A popular choice for managed Kubernetes is Amazon EKS. It’s no wonder that platform teams are on a quest to better manage, scale, and secure their Amazon EKS clusters across disparate internal application teams while working with multiple AWS accounts in multiple AWS Regions. AWS Partner Rafay Systems helps hundreds of enterprises reduce the complexity of Kubernetes. In this lightning talk, learn best practices on streamlining Kubernetes from self-service cluster provisioning through to centralized policy management. Bootstrapping “batteries-included” Amazon EKS clusters In this builders’ session, learn about using Amazon EKS Blueprints for Terraform to configure and deploy “batteries-included” Amazon EKS clusters. Dive deep into EKS Blueprints code and learn to deploy security-compliant EKS clusters with managed node groups and AWS Fargate profiles. Learn how to build EKS clusters that support workloads from multiple teams with EKS Blueprint’s teams functionality. Lastly, learn how to easily deploy AWS managed add-ons (like VPC CNI, CoreDNS, and kube-proxy) in addition to popular open-source add-ons, including Metrics Server, cluster autoscaler, Prometheus, Karpenter, AWS Load Balancer Controller, Fluent Bit, and Argo CD. Build Kubernetes at scale using AWS file services Learn how you can launch and use Amazon FSx fully managed file services to power your Amazon EKS Kubernetes container workloads. Deploy a container-based workload with persistent storage from Amazon FSx to better understand the benefits and key features for container-based workloads. The workshop also touches on dimensions such as performance, scale, high availability, and how to create clones of your DevOps data in seconds, or replicate and access your data seamlessly across AWS Regions, to further power at-scale container-based workloads. Data analysis with Amazon EKS and AWS Batch Gain an understanding of the recently added AWS Batch support for managing and scheduling large-scale data analysis using Amazon EKS. Learn AWS Batch fundamental concepts and how AWS Batch works together with your other AWS services running within Amazon EKS. Deploy an Amazon EKS cluster, leverage AWS Batch to manage pods, and train a simple machine learning model. Disaster recovery, high availability, and resiliency on Amazon EKS Kubernetes application development and operations teams need to build resilient systems that embrace failure as a natural occurrence. Learn about patterns and strategies for running resilient Kubernetes clusters on AWS. Use chaos engineering tools to simulate failures and disaster scenarios for Kubernetes clusters on AWS and learn how to recover from them within given recovery time and recovery point objectives. Getting started with Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) Introduction to Kubernetes using the AWS managed Kubernetes service Amazon EKS. Previous experience with Kubernetes or container workflows is useful but not required. During this workshop you deploy everything needed to have a set of microservices running with additional useful day-2 functionality in place. The workshop includes deploying a set of microservices, configuring a load balancer in front of your service, configuring centralized logging, and enabling automatic scaling of your pods and worker nodes. How to monitor and reduce your compute costs As organizations adopt Amazon EKS to securely and reliably run their mission-critical workloads in the AWS cloud and on premises, it is essential that they have tools to monitor and optimize what they spend to run their Kubernetes applications. This builders’ session demonstrates cost-reduction steps in a sample architecture and then shows ways you can identify and reduce compute costs in your environment using OpenCost, Kubecost, Karpenter, and AWS Graviton.

It had a unique rubber keyboard. I used to spend hours on it writing BASIC programs \u0026amp; playing games.\nI spent so long on the Spectrum one of my sisters suggested I should go to computing college which was absolutely the right decision for me, I never looked back.\nTomorrow\u0026rsquo;s World broadcast a computer program which I saved and loaded on the Spectrum, this was the first time I received anything remotely, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t understand how this was possible at the time, it took a few days for it to sink in !\nZX Spectrum 48k Peripherals Alphacom 32 thermal printer Competition Pro joystick Kempston joystick interface Tape player/recorder I always wanted a ZX Microdrive but couldn\u0026rsquo;t afford it Magazines Crash Commodore 64 (1982) I was just blown away by this computer, it was the first time I appreciated the impact of Moore\u0026rsquo;s law\nPeripherals Action Replay (Datel Electronics) This was pretty much the first peripheral I bought for a home computer, I was blown away that the computer could be extended and modified at the hardware level. I used this to save game state and hacking games typing in pokes \u0026amp; cheat codes etc. Commodore 64 Communications Modem (Compunet) This completely blew my mind as it was the first time I got online and connected to other computer systems such as bulletin boards \u0026amp; Compunet. Compunet was also the first time I sent \u0026amp; received email, I remember I couldn\u0026rsquo;t wait to get home for school to see if I had any new email. My phone bill was ridiculous, to this day I still can\u0026rsquo;t believe I got away with spending so long and so much money on phone bills, my parents obviously thought it was worthwhile. Come to think of it I was extremely lucky to have early access to many great computers \u0026amp; peripherals.

This has been one of my favourite jobs over the years as I had a lot of responsbility and had to do a lot of problem solving late into the evening, I learnt a lot.
