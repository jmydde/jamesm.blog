It had a unique rubber keyboard. I used to spend hours on it writing BASIC programs \u0026amp; playing games.\nI spent so long on the Spectrum one of my sisters suggested I should go to computing college which was absolutely the right decision for me, I never looked back.\nTomorrow\u0026rsquo;s World broadcast a computer program which I saved and loaded on the Spectrum, this was the first time I received anything remotely, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t understand how this was possible at the time, it took a few days for it to sink in !\nZX Spectrum 48k Peripherals Alphacom 32 thermal printer Competition Pro joystick Kempston joystick interface Tape player/recorder I always wanted a ZX Microdrive but couldn\u0026rsquo;t afford it Magazines Crash Commodore 64 (1982) I was just blown away by this computer, it was the first time I appreciated the impact of Moore\u0026rsquo;s law\nPeripherals Action Replay (Datel Electronics) This was pretty much the first peripheral I bought for a home computer, I was blown away that the computer could be extended and modified at the hardware level. I used this to save game state and hacking games typing in pokes \u0026amp; cheat codes etc. Commodore 64 Communications Modem (Compunet) This completely blew my mind as it was the first time I got online and connected to other computer systems such as bulletin boards \u0026amp; Compunet. Compunet was also the first time I sent \u0026amp; received email, I remember I couldn\u0026rsquo;t wait to get home for school to see if I had any new email. My phone bill was ridiculous, to this day I still can\u0026rsquo;t believe I got away with spending so long and so much money on phone bills, my parents obviously thought it was worthwhile. Come to think of it I was extremely lucky to have early access to many great computers \u0026amp; peripherals.
