      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;about&#34;&gt;About&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The SpaceX Starfactory is the heart of Starship production, located within the Starbase complex in Boca Chica, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s goal is to mass produce Starship rockets, with an ambitious target of one Starship per day!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This vast facility manufactures and assembles Starship vehicles, including both the Starship spacecraft itself and the Super Heavy booster that launches it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Starfactory is still under construction, but with ongoing expansion it&amp;rsquo;s expected to reach its full production potential soon.  SpaceX views Starfactory as crucial to achieving their long-term goals - regular space travel and missions to Mars. By streamlining Starship production, they hope to dramatically increase launch cadence and make space more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
