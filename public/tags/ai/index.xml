      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spec-Driven Development is starting to reshape how modern software is planned, built, and maintained. Among the tools pushing this shift forward, <strong>GitHub Spec Kit</strong> stands out as one of the clearest, cleanest ways to bring structure and intention into your workflow. It turns the usual chaos of planning into something organised, navigable, and repeatable - and when combined with AI-powered editors like Cursor, it becomes even more powerful.</p>
<p>This post explores what GitHub Spec Kit is, how Spec-Driven Development works, and why the pairing with Cursor AI creates a genuinely new style of building software.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-is-github-spec-kit">What Is GitHub Spec Kit?</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/github/spec-kit">GitHub Spec Kit</a> is a lightweight but highly structured framework for documenting how a software project should work. Instead of scattering requirements across random Notion pages, Slack threads, and half-remembered conversations, Spec Kit gathers everything into a set of version-controlled markdown files stored directly in your repository.</p>
<p>A typical Spec Kit includes documents like:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>spec.md</code> - the core functional specification</li>
<li><code>constitution.md</code> - high-level rules, constraints, and architectural principles</li>
<li><code>boundaries.md</code> - what the system does <em>not</em> cover</li>
<li><code>glossary.md</code> - domain-specific terminology</li>
<li>Additional files for requirements, acceptance criteria, workflows, decisions, and more</li>
</ul>
<p>This set of files acts as the “source of truth” for the entire project. Any change to the system’s intent, scope, or architecture becomes a pull request. Every contributor works from the same shared mental model. Drift disappears because the spec becomes part of the codebase.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-is-spec-driven-development-sdd">What Is Spec-Driven Development (SDD)?</h2>
<p>Spec-Driven Development is a workflow where <strong>the specification is the central reference point</strong> and <strong>code is generated, updated, or refactored in alignment with it</strong>.</p>
<p>Instead of writing documentation <em>after</em> the code (or never at all), the spec becomes the starting point. The process typically flows like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define the behaviour, boundaries, rules, and intent in the spec.</li>
<li>Use the spec to guide implementation.</li>
<li>If the implementation reveals a better approach, update the spec first.</li>
<li>Let the spec drive the next iteration of code.</li>
</ol>
<p>It creates a cycle where clarity leads the way. The spec evolves alongside the code, and both reinforce each other. It’s development through explicit thinking rather than retroactive explanation.</p>
<p>SDD is especially powerful for long-term projects, large teams, or any system where architectural drift is a real risk.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="integrating-spec-kit-with-cursor-ai">Integrating Spec Kit with Cursor AI</h2>
<p>The magic begins when GitHub Spec Kit meets <a href="https://www.cursor.com/">Cursor AI</a>.</p>
<p>Cursor can read your entire repository - including the Spec Kit files - and treat them as authoritative guidance. This turns the spec into something active and operational rather than static and decorative.</p>
<p>With Cursor:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can instruct the AI to generate code strictly aligned with the spec.</li>
<li>Cursor can highlight when a request conflicts with documented constraints.</li>
<li>Refactoring becomes safer because the AI understands the system’s rules.</li>
<li>Updating the spec instantly influences future code suggestions.</li>
<li>New contributors can ask Cursor to <em>explain</em> the spec to them in context.</li>
</ul>
<p>The result is a workflow where the spec isn’t just a document. It becomes the central nervous system of the entire development experience.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-this-approach-feels-like-the-future">Why This Approach Feels Like the Future</h2>
<p>SDD doesn’t eliminate creativity; it channels it.<br>
It keeps the vision sharp, maintains consistency, and prevents entropy from creeping into the project. The combination of <strong>GitHub Spec Kit + Cursor AI</strong> creates a loop where:</p>
<ul>
<li>ideas become structured,</li>
<li>structure becomes implementation,</li>
<li>implementation feeds back into structure,</li>
<li>and the whole system stays aligned over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>The result is development that’s clearer, faster, and vastly easier to maintain.</p>
<p>Spec-Driven Development isn’t just a documentation style - it’s a way of thinking about software with more intention and less chaos. And with the right tools, it feels like the natural next step in how modern systems should be built.</p>

      <title>Cursor AI, Spec-Driven Magic, and Why My Entire Development Workflow Just Leveled Up 🤯</title>
      <link>https://jamesm.blog/ai/cursor-ai/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 13:15:25 +0100</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every so often a tool appears that doesn’t just streamline your workflow - it rewires the way you think about building software. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cursor.com/&#34;&gt;Cursor AI&lt;/a&gt; has done exactly that. After years of bouncing between editors, IDEs, extensions, and automation layers, nothing has delivered the same sense of &lt;em&gt;“this is the future of development”&lt;/em&gt; as Cursor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cursor isn’t simply an AI-augmented editor. It feels like a true development partner. It reads your repo with real architectural awareness, reasons across files, maintains context, and helps you iterate on ideas with an almost uncanny understanding of intent. Complex refactors turn into simple conversations. Vague concepts turn into working code. The entire process becomes fluid.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every so often a tool appears that doesn’t just streamline your workflow - it rewires the way you think about building software. <a href="https://www.cursor.com/">Cursor AI</a> has done exactly that. After years of bouncing between editors, IDEs, extensions, and automation layers, nothing has delivered the same sense of <em>“this is the future of development”</em> as Cursor.</p>
<p>Cursor isn’t simply an AI-augmented editor. It feels like a true development partner. It reads your repo with real architectural awareness, reasons across files, maintains context, and helps you iterate on ideas with an almost uncanny understanding of intent. Complex refactors turn into simple conversations. Vague concepts turn into working code. The entire process becomes fluid.</p>
<p>The experience is difficult to overstate: it changes how you approach building software.</p>
<h3 id="integrating-github-spec-kit-the-missing-link">Integrating GitHub Spec Kit: The Missing Link</h3>
<p>The biggest leap in my own workflow has come from integrating GitHub Spec Kit into Cursor. Spec Kit provides a structured foundation - <code>spec.md</code>, <code>constitution.md</code>, requirements, boundaries, acceptance criteria - everything that keeps a project coherent as it evolves.</p>
<p>Cursor treats those specs as living, authoritative documents. Once the rules and expectations are written down, Cursor uses them as constraints. It respects them, enforces them, and even highlights when code drifts away from them. Instead of planning in one place and coding in another, everything merges into a single iterative loop:</p>
<p><strong>Refine the spec → Ask Cursor to implement → Update the spec → Generate more code → Improve architecture → Repeat.</strong></p>
<p>It feels closer to a “development operating system” than an editor - documentation, code, and reasoning all feed into each other in real time.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-combination-feels-revolutionary">Why This Combination Feels Revolutionary</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Automatic consistency.</strong><br>
Cursor keeps code aligned with the spec, reducing drift and ambiguity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Architecture that stays clean.</strong><br>
Spec Kit defines the structure; Cursor continuously references it while generating and refactoring code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Effortless onboarding.</strong><br>
New contributors can read the spec and ask Cursor questions directly against it, bypassing tribal knowledge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Faster iteration than ever.</strong><br>
Ideas move from head → spec → implementation within minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fearless refactoring.</strong><br>
With a clear spec and an AI that understands intent, large-scale changes become safe and manageable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-future-is-taking-shape">The Future Is Taking Shape</h3>
<p>It’s clear that we’re watching a major shift in how software will be built. Cursor makes development conversational. GitHub Spec Kit makes it structured. Together they create a development environment that feels faster, clearer, and more expressive than anything I’ve used before.</p>
<p>These tools don’t replace developers - they amplify them. They eliminate friction between thought and execution. They let you think at a higher level without drowning in boilerplate or context switching.</p>
<p>The combination of Cursor AI and GitHub Spec Kit genuinely feels like the next chapter of software development. Coding feels different now - more intuitive, more powerful - and I can’t imagine going back.</p>

      <title>Top 5 Human In-Demand Jobs in 10 Years</title>
      <link>https://jamesm.blog/ai/human-in-demand-jobs/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 07:39:14 +0100</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assume AI is “everywhere” – what still &lt;strong&gt;needs&lt;/strong&gt; actual humans?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When AI eats routine tasks, jobs don’t disappear – they &lt;strong&gt;mutate&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything that leans heavily on &lt;strong&gt;judgement, emotion, trust, embodied skill, or accountability&lt;/strong&gt; stays human-shaped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-human-relationship-professionals&#34;&gt;1. Human Relationship Professionals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The negotiators of human chaos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are roles where the “job” is less about information and more about &lt;strong&gt;being with&lt;/strong&gt; another human in difficulty or growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they remain in demand:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Assume AI is “everywhere” – what still <strong>needs</strong> actual humans?</em></p>
<p>When AI eats routine tasks, jobs don’t disappear – they <strong>mutate</strong>.</p>
<p>Anything that leans heavily on <strong>judgement, emotion, trust, embodied skill, or accountability</strong> stays human-shaped.</p>
<h2 id="1-human-relationship-professionals">1. Human Relationship Professionals</h2>
<p><em>The negotiators of human chaos</em></p>
<p>These are roles where the “job” is less about information and more about <strong>being with</strong> another human in difficulty or growth.</p>
<p><strong>Why they remain in demand:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>People don’t want a chatbot when:
<ul>
<li>their marriage is collapsing</li>
<li>they’re grieving</li>
<li>their kid is melting down at school</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trust is built on <strong>shared vulnerability</strong>, body language, tone, presence. AI can simulate empathy, but it doesn’t <em>have skin in the game</em>.</li>
<li>Ethical and safeguarding responsibilities (e.g. mandatory reporting, complex family situations) benefit from human judgment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Therapists, counsellors, psychotherapists</li>
<li>Social workers, family support workers</li>
<li>Mediators (family, workplace, community)</li>
<li>Coaches and mentors (career, life, performance)</li>
<li>Teachers and specialist educators</li>
<li>Carers for children, elderly, and neurodiverse people</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How AI fits in:</strong><br>
AI will assist (notes, suggestions, diagnostics, admin, lesson planning), but the <strong>core interaction</strong> will still be human-to-human.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-ai-wranglers--system-architects">2. AI Wranglers &amp; System Architects</h2>
<p><em>The keepers of the machine zoo</em></p>
<p>As AI systems get more capable, they become more like <strong>power tools</strong> and less like “apps”. Someone has to specify, supervise and constrain them.</p>
<p><strong>Why they remain in demand:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Powerful systems need <strong>alignment</strong> with human goals, ethics, and regulation.</li>
<li>Organizations will need humans who understand:
<ul>
<li>what the system <strong>can</strong> do</li>
<li>what it <strong>shouldn’t</strong> do</li>
<li>how to detect when it’s gone off the rails</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Risk, compliance, and governance around AI will be a huge domain.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>AI safety / alignment engineers</li>
<li>AI governance / risk architects</li>
<li>Data quality stewards &amp; bias auditors</li>
<li>Human-in-the-loop supervision roles</li>
<li>Prompt / system / workflow designers</li>
<li>People who design <strong>AI + human</strong> workflows, not just “use AI here”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How AI fits in:</strong><br>
AI will help build more AI, but humans set <strong>objectives, constraints, and guardrails</strong>, and own the consequences when things go wrong.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="3-skilled-trades--physical-infrastructure">3. Skilled Trades &amp; Physical Infrastructure</h2>
<p><em>The people who fix the non-virtual mess</em></p>
<p>Software eats the world, but it still can’t fix your boiler or crawl into the loft.</p>
<p><strong>Why they remain in demand:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Real buildings, pipes, wires, and machines live in:
<ul>
<li>cramped spaces</li>
<li>weird legacy configurations</li>
<li>unpredictable conditions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Robotics will exist, but <strong>general-purpose, cheap, safe, robust robots</strong> that can handle every UK home or random building site? That’s a much harder problem.</li>
<li>These jobs often need:
<ul>
<li>improvisation</li>
<li>risk awareness</li>
<li>physical dexterity</li>
<li>on-site judgment</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Plumbers, electricians, gas engineers</li>
<li>Roofers, builders, joiners</li>
<li>HVAC and building services engineers</li>
<li>Lift / escalator / industrial machinery engineers</li>
<li>Robotics installation and maintenance techs</li>
<li>On-site field engineers of many kinds</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How AI fits in:</strong><br>
AI will guide diagnostics (“this error code usually means X”), planning, and logistics – but <strong>the hands-on work</strong> is human.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="4-creative-producers--world-builders">4. Creative Producers &amp; World-Builders</h2>
<p><em>The meaning-makers in a world drowning in content</em></p>
<p>AI can mass-generate music, images, copy, and entire video sequences. That doesn’t solve the harder problem: <strong>what do humans actually care about?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why they remain in demand:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>People don’t just want <em>content</em>; they want:
<ul>
<li>identity</li>
<li>stories</li>
<li>cultural signals</li>
<li>emotional resonance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Taste, curation, and cultural leadership are <strong>social</strong>, not computational.</li>
<li>The more “infinite AI content” we have, the more valuable <strong>trusted human voices and brands</strong> become.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Creative directors and showrunners</li>
<li>Musicians, performers, actors, comedians, DJs (especially live)</li>
<li>Story and world-builders (games, films, interactive experiences)</li>
<li>Brand and experience designers</li>
<li>Concept / narrative designers for products, games, and apps</li>
<li>Curators, editors, and community leaders</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How AI fits in:</strong><br>
AI becomes an <strong>insanely powerful instrument</strong> – like a limitless synthesizer or graphics workstation. The human decides <em>what to make</em>, <em>when it’s finished</em>, and <em>what it means</em>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="5-human-trust--accountability-roles">5. Human Trust &amp; Accountability Roles</h2>
<p><em>The “adult in the room” when stakes are high</em></p>
<p>Where there is <strong>serious risk, regulation, or life-changing consequence</strong>, societies will want a human ultimately on the hook.</p>
<p><strong>Why they remain in demand:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>AI can assist with recommendations, but:
<ul>
<li>Who signs off on a risky surgery?</li>
<li>Who signs a legal opinion that goes to court?</li>
<li>Who takes responsibility when a financial product wipes someone out?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These roles sit at the intersection of:
<ul>
<li>technical knowledge</li>
<li>ethics</li>
<li>law / regulation</li>
<li>human communication and negotiation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Doctors, surgeons, senior clinicians</li>
<li>Pilots and flight crew (even with near-full automation)</li>
<li>Lawyers, judges, mediators, compliance officers</li>
<li>Regulated financial advisers and portfolio managers</li>
<li>Public safety and emergency responders</li>
<li>Senior decision-makers in critical infrastructure (energy, transport, health)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How AI fits in:</strong><br>
AI will be like a <strong>super-analyst</strong> sitting next to them. But when something goes wrong, regulators and the public will look for a <strong>human</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-meta-pattern-interpretation-vs-execution">The Meta-Pattern: Interpretation vs Execution</h2>
<p>AI is getting absurdly good at <strong>execution</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>generating code, text, images, designs</li>
<li>summarizing, translating, optimising, scheduling</li>
</ul>
<p>The jobs that survive and thrive are those focused on <strong>interpretation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>what should we build?</li>
<li>which outcome matters?</li>
<li>whose values are at stake?</li>
<li>how do we trade off risk vs reward?</li>
<li>how do we care for the humans affected?</li>
</ul>
<p>In 10 years, the high-value humans will be those who can:</p>
<ul>
<li>wield AI tools fluently, <strong>and</strong></li>
<li>bring <strong>judgment, empathy, responsibility, and taste</strong> into the loop.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the stack to build towards.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://suno.com/&#34;&gt;Suno&lt;/a&gt; Suno has launched &lt;a href=&#34;https://suno.com/studio-welcome&#34;&gt;Suno Studio&lt;/a&gt;, a cloud-based platform it calls the first generative DAW - a digital audio workstation built around AI. Unlike traditional DAWs that rely only on pre-recorded sounds, Suno Studio puts generative technology at the core, letting creators compose, edit, and arrange music directly from text prompts while still offering pro-level multitrack tools. Users can upload samples, tweak tempo, pitch, and volume, and export stems for use in other software.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://suno.com/">Suno</a> Suno has launched <a href="https://suno.com/studio-welcome">Suno Studio</a>, a cloud-based platform it calls the first generative DAW - a digital audio workstation built around AI. Unlike traditional DAWs that rely only on pre-recorded sounds, Suno Studio puts generative technology at the core, letting creators compose, edit, and arrange music directly from text prompts while still offering pro-level multitrack tools. Users can upload samples, tweak tempo, pitch, and volume, and export stems for use in other software.</p>
<p>The release follows Suno’s v5 model, which the company says can “compose like a musician and adapt like a co-writer.” CEO Mikey Shulman frames it as part of a wider shift where AI becomes a regular partner in the studio.</p>
<p>Early testers highlight its speed, flexible interface, and vast sound library—features that cut down on hunting for samples and speed up experimentation. But they also note AI still struggles to match very specific creative demands.</p>
<p>Suno Studio launches amid industry scrutiny over copyright and arrives as Spotify introduces new policies to label AI-generated music. The platform is available through Suno’s $30/month Premier plan.</p>

<p>The goal is for Optimus to be <strong>less than half the cost of a Tesla car</strong>;</p>
<ul>
<li>this translates to roughly $20,000 to $25,000 based on current Tesla car prices</li>
<li>the price could eventually fall even lower as production scales up</li>
</ul>
<p>Musk has predicted long-term their robot will probably be worth <strong>significantly more</strong> than the car side of their business.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://bostondynamics.com/atlas/">All New Atlas</a> is Boston Dynamic&rsquo;s first all-electric humanoid robot, designed for real-world applications, it has a far more human-like body. However it&rsquo;s still a long way from commercial or consumer availability.</p>
<p>The next generation of the <a href="https://bostondynamics.com/atlas/">Atlas</a> program builds on decades of research and furthers their commitment to delivering the most capable, useful mobile robots. An advanced control system and state-of-the-art hardware give the robot the power and balance to demonstrate advanced athletics and agility.</p>
<p>They use <a href="https://bostondynamics.com/atlas/">Atlas</a> to explore the potential of the humanoid form factor, leveraging the robot’s whole body to move with grace, speed, and dexterity. <a href="https://bostondynamics.com/atlas/">Atlas</a> demonstrates their efforts to develop the next generation of robots with the mobility, perception, and intelligence needed to be commonplace in our lives.</p>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;about&#34;&gt;About&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s Voice Engine is a text-to-speech tool which can create realistic voices from just a 15-second audio sample.  It is notable that a small model with a single 15-second sample can create emotive and realistic voices.  To ensure responsible use testers must get clear consent from voice providers, avoid creating user-generated voices, and inform listeners that the voices are AI-generated.&lt;/p&gt;
