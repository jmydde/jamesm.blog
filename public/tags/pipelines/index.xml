      <description>DevOps Amazon&amp;rsquo;s approach to high-availability deployment Continuous-delivery failures can lead to reduced service availability and bad customer experiences. To maximize the rate of successful deployments, Amazon&amp;rsquo;s development teams implement guardrails in the end-to-end release process to minimize deployment errors, with a goal of achieving zero deployment failures. In this session, learn the continuous-delivery practices that we invented that help raise the bar and prevent costly deployment failures. Automating cross-account CI/CD pipelines When building a deployment strategy for your applications, using a multi-account approach is a recommended best practice.</description>
