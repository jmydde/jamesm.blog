## Suno Voice Personas: Consistent Vocals, Creative Freedom

Suno has just rolled out a **vocal-first update to Personas**, and it’s a genuinely important shift for anyone creating music at scale.

For the first time, you can build an entire album around the **same vocalist**, without being locked into a specific instrumental style.

### What’s New: Voice Personas

**Voice Personas** are designed to focus on what most creators care about first — the singer.

**Key characteristics:**

- **Vocal-only focus**  
  The Persona captures the *voice itself*, allowing your vocalist to stay consistent as you create new songs.

- **No inherited instrumentation**  
  Voice Personas don’t inherit genre, tempo, or arrangement, so you’re free to explore different musical styles while keeping the same singer.

- **Built for albums and larger projects**  
  You can now create a cohesive body of work where the vocal identity stays stable even as the sound evolves.

This gives creators continuity *without* creative constraint — a rare and powerful combination.

### Style Personas (Legacy)

The original **Style Personas** remain available and behave as before:

- Include **reference instrumentation and style**
- Useful for recreating or staying within a specific sonic palette
- **Do not maintain the same voice** from song to song

**In short:**

- **Voice Personas** → singer consistency  
- **Style Personas** → sound and instrumentation consistency

Both approaches are valuable — it simply depends on whether the voice or the overall sound is your priority.

### Beta Status

Voice Personas are currently **in beta** and will continue to improve over time. Expect refinements in vocal nuance, stability, and expressive detail as Suno develops the feature further.
