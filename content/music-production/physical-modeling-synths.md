## About
Physical modelling is a process of recreating the physical reactions and unique interplay of both physical and electronic components using mathematical models and algorithms to create a realistic reproduction.

Physically modelled instruments simulate the playability and complex behaviour of real acoustic instruments.

Because there are no samples, the file size of these plugins are just a tiny fraction of that required by other virtual instruments.

## List of Physical Modeling Plugins
- [Applied Acoustics Systems](https://www.applied-acoustics.com/)
  - [Chromaphone](https://www.applied-acoustics.com/chromaphone-3/) - creative synthesis with real-life acoustic character
  - [Ultra Analog VA-3](https://www.applied-acoustics.com/ultra-analog-va-3/) - performs as a unique and powerful synth that is fast, easy, and remarkably versatile
- [Arturia](https://www.arturia.com/)
  - [Piano V](https://www.arturia.com/products/software-instruments/piano-v/overview) - finest array of production-worthy pianos
- [Expressive E](https://www.expressivee.com/)
  - [imagine](https://www.expressivee.com/63-imagine) - a playful world of unknown acoustic sounds
- [Modartt](https://www.modartt.com/)
  - [Pianoteq](https://www.modartt.com/pianoteq_overview) - award-winning virtual instrument
- [Physical Audio](https://physicalaudio.co.uk/)
  - [Derailer](https://physicalaudio.co.uk/products/derailer/) - physical modelling instrument plugin built from mathematical models of strings, bars and spring connection elements
  - [Preparation](https://physicalaudio.co.uk/products/preparation/) - based on mathematical modelling of 2 basic elements; strings which can be configured as bars, and a rattling element
- [Rhizomatic](https://rhizomatic.fr/)
  - [Plasmonic](https://rhizomatic.fr/) - captures the complex acoustic resonances of Physical Modeling, expands on it with more familiar elements of Subtractive Synthesis, and adds a few unique twists
