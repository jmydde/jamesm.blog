## About
Physical modelling is a process of recreating the physical reactions and unique interplay of both physical and electronic components using mathematical models and algorithms to create a realistic reproduction.
- Physically modelled instruments simulate the playability and complex behaviour of real acoustic instruments.
- Because there are no samples, the file size of these plugins are just a tiny fraction of that required by other virtual instruments.

This is an excellent overview of physical modeling compared to sampling;
