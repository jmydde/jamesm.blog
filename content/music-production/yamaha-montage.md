## About
The [Yamaha Montage M](https://uk.yamaha.com/en/products/music_production/synthesizers/montagem/index.html) was released in the UK on 10th October 2023.  

It is the next-generation **flagship synthesizer** from Yamaha, building on the success of the original Montage. It boasts several improvements and new features designed to enhance the sound, control, and workflow for professional keyboardists.

Here is a summary of the key aspects of the Yamaha Montage M
- **Three Powerful Engines** -  Like its predecessor, Montage M features three sound engines: AN-X, AWM2, and FM-X. These engines offer a vast sonic palette, allowing you to create warm vintage analog tones, cutting-edge FM sounds, and ultra-realistic acoustic instruments.
- **Increased Polyphony** - A significant upgrade is the 400-note total polyphony, a jump from the original Montage's 256 notes. This allows for more complex and layered sounds without worrying about dropped notes.
- **New AN-X Virtual Analog Engine** - This engine offers a fresh take on virtual analog synthesis, providing more detailed control over sound shaping.
- **Improved User Interface** - The Montage M features a redesigned user interface with new easy-edit pages and shortcuts, making sound creation and editing more intuitive and efficient.
- **Additional Knobs and Encoders** - More physical controls give you more immediate access to tweak parameters and add dynamics to your performance.
- **VCM Rotary Speaker Effect** - This new effect accurately emulates the classic sound of a Leslie speaker cabinet, adding warmth and movement to organ and electric piano sounds.
- **Powerful USB Audio Interface** - The Montage M functions as a 6-in/32-out USB audio interface, allowing you to record audio directly to your DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) for seamless integration into your studio workflow.

The Montage M comes in three versions, each with a different keyboard action
- **M6** - 61-key FSX synth action (ideal for portability and playing melodies).
- **M7** - 76-key FSX synth action (a good balance between portability and playability for splits and layers).
- **M8X** - 88-key weighted hammer action with polyphonic aftertouch (perfect for pianists who need a realistic piano feel and expressive control).

Overall, the Yamaha Montage M is a premium synthesizer workstation offering a powerful combination of sound quality, versatile sound engines, improved control options, and seamless studio integration. It caters to professional keyboardists who demand the best in performance and production capabilities.
