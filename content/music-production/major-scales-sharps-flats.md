# How to Work Out the Number of Sharps in Each Major Scale

Understanding the number of sharps in major scales is easier than it sounds once you know the **circle of fifths** and the pattern of sharps. Here’s a step-by-step guide to make it simple.

---

## 1. Start with C Major

C Major is your reference point. It has:

- **No sharps or flats**
- Notes: `C D E F G A B`

Think of C Major as the “home base” of all major scales.

## 2. What is a Perfect Fifth?

A **perfect fifth** is one of the most fundamental intervals in music:

- It is the distance between two notes spanning **7 semitones** (half-steps).  
- Called “perfect” because it sounds **very stable and consonant**.  
- Examples:  
  - `C → G`  
  - `D → A`  
  - `G → D`  

**Shortcut trick:**  
- Count **five letter names** starting from the root note.  
  - C (1), D (2), E (3), F (4), G (5) → perfect fifth.  
- Adjust for sharps/flats as needed.

## 3. Move Up by Fifths to Add Sharps

Every time you move **up a perfect fifth** (7 semitones), you **add one sharp** to the scale.

The **order of sharps** is:

```

F#, C#, G#, D#, A#, E#, B#

```

Mnemonic to remember this:

## 4. Major Scales With Sharps

Here’s the sequence of major scales as you move up by fifths:

| Major Scale | Number of Sharps | Sharps in Scale           |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| C           | 0               | —                         |
| G           | 1               | F#                        |
| D           | 2               | F#, C#                    |
| A           | 3               | F#, C#, G#                |
| E           | 4               | F#, C#, G#, D#            |
| B           | 5               | F#, C#, G#, D#, A#        |
| F#          | 6               | F#, C#, G#, D#, A#, E#    |
| C#          | 7               | F#, C#, G#, D#, A#, E#, B#|

Notice the pattern: **each time you move up a fifth, add one sharp**.

## 5. Using Flats Instead

If a scale uses **flats** instead of sharps:

- Move **down a fifth** each time.
- Order of flats:

```

B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭, C♭, F♭

```

Mnemonic for flats:  

> **Battle Ends And Down Goes Charles’ Father**

## 6. Circle of Fifths Cheat Sheet

**Sharps (Clockwise):**  
```

C → G → D → A → E → B → F# → C#

```

**Flats (Counterclockwise):**  
```

C → F → Bb → Eb → Ab → Db → Gb → Cb

```

**Quick Tips:**

- **Sharps:** Add one each fifth clockwise from C.  
- **Flats:** Add one each fifth counterclockwise from C.  
- The **order of sharps/flats never changes**, so you can instantly write out any major scale.

With this method, you’ll never have to wonder how many sharps are in a major scale again!
