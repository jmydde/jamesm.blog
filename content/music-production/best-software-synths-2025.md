## Closing Thoughts
What sets 2025 apart isn’t just feature lists or spec sheets - it’s **integration and expressivity**. Synth engines interweave sampling, granular processing, and spectral manipulation. Interfaces are more dynamic and interactive than ever. And tools like Pigments 7 are teaching users *as they play*, turning complex sound design into a tactile experience. Whether you’re scoring films, designing textures, or producing club‑ready tracks, this year’s synth roster delivers both power and inspiration.
