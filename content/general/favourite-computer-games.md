## Commodore PET (1977)
The [Commodore PET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PET/)  was the first computer I learnt BASIC on at school, in the computing club.  

The first program I wrote was an animated Christmas card as part of a  school competition, I was quite proud of it.  We were meant to showcase all of our programs at a public school event however I forgot to take the tape with me to school, I was truly gutted.   I also mislaid the tape at home so have lost all those initial programs I wrote :(

## Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48k
The [Spectrum 48k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum) was my very first home computer and therefore was very special to me.  It had a unique rubber keyboard.  I used to spend hours on it writing BASIC programs & playing games.
