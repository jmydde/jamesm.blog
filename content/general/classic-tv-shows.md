## Johnny Ball
[Johnny Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Ball) was an absolute legend, I grew up watching all of his shows;
- Think of a Number (6 series, 6 editions each)
- Think Again (5 series, 5/6 editions each)
- Think!Backwards (5 editions)
- Think! This Way (5 editions)
- Think It ... Do It (2 series, 6 editions each)
- Knowhow (3 series, 6 editions each)
- Johnny Ball Reveals All (5 series, 5-7 editions each)

I don't understand why we still don't have educational programs like this on TV today ...
