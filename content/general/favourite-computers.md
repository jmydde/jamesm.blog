A list of all my favourite computes, phones & games consoles I've mostly owned or used at school & college, in order of purchase / initial use ...

## Computers

### Commodore PET (1977)
The [Commodore PET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PET/) was the first computer I learnt BASIC in the school computing club (1981)

The first program I wrote was an animated Christmas card as part of a  school competition, I was quite proud of it.  We were meant to showcase all of our programs at a public school event however I forgot to take the tape with me to school, I was truly gutted.   I also mislaid the tape at home so have lost all those initial programs I wrote :(

### BBC Micro Model B (1981)
I didn't own this personally at home but used it in the school computing club

### Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48k (1982)
The [Spectrum 48k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum) was my very first home computer and therefore was very special to me.  It had a unique rubber keyboard.  I used to spend hours on it writing BASIC programs & playing games.

I spent so long on the Spectrum one of my sisters suggested I should go to computing college which was absolutely the right decision for me, I never looked back.

[Tomorrow's World broadcast a computer program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeKWMXuSGCc) which I saved and loaded on the Spectrum, this was the first time I received anything remotely, I couldn't understand how this was possible at the time, it took a few days for it to sink in !

#### Peripherals
- [Alphacom 32](https://worldofspectrum.org/hardware/feat11.html) thermal printer
- [Competition Pro joystick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kempston_Micro_Electronics/)
- [Kempston joystick interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kempston_Micro_Electronics/)
- Tape player/recorder
- I always wanted a [ZX Microdrive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Microdrive) but couldn't afford it

#### Magazines
- [Crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_(magazine)/)

### Commodore 64 (1982)
I was just blown away by this computer, it was the first time I appreciated the impact of [Moore's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law/)

#### Peripherals
- [Action Replay](https://rr.pokefinder.org/wiki/Action_Replay/) (Datel Electronics)
  - This was pretty much the first peripheral I bought for a home computer, I was blown away that the computer could be extended and modified at the hardware level.  I used this to save game state and hacking games typing in pokes & cheat codes etc.
- [Commodore 64 Communications Modem (Compunet)](https://www.nightfallcrew.com/27/02/2021/commodore-64-communications-modem-compunet/)
  - This completely blew my mind as it was the first time I got online from home, to connect to other computer systems such as bulletin boards & Compunet.  
  - Compunet was also the first time I sent & received email, I remember I couldn't wait to get home for school to see if I had any new email, seeing the envelope icon appearing & flashing next to a postbox was **magical** to me.  
  - My phone bill was ridiculous (£100s per month, and this was back in the 80s), to this day I still can't believe I got away with spending so long and so much money on phone bills, my parents obviously thought it would be benefical for me and / or perhaps it kept me out of trouble.  
  - Come to think of it I was **extremely** lucky to have early access to many great computers & peripherals, at home & school :)

### Apple IIe (1983)
My dad had one of these at home, although I only really used it to play a few games
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIe

### IBM Personal Computer (1983)
We used the [IBM Personal Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer/) at computing college to learn;
- [Assembly language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language/) - low level programming
- [Borland Turbo Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal/) - programming language
- [Lotus 1-2-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_1-2-3) - spreadsheet
- [Microsoft MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS) - operating system

### Data General Eclipse MV/15000 (1986)
As part of my first job as a computer operator (1992) I was responsible for operating the [Data General](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_General/) **MV/15000** mainframe computer & writing automation scripts.  This has been one of my favourite jobs over the years as I had a lot of responsbility and had to do a lot of problem solving late into the evening, I learnt a lot.   We didn't have the internet or up-to-date manuals back then :)

#### Peripherals
- [Kyocera Laser Printer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyocera/)
  - I programmed using Page Description Language (PDL) to re-create a load of forms which we previously had to buy externally pre-printed, this saved us a lot of money.

#### Software
- [AOS/VS II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOS/VS_II/) - Operating System
  - [CLI32](http://phrack.org/issues/44/14.html/) - developing automation scripts
- [Micro Focus COBOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Focus) - developing reports
- [Cyberscience CyberQuery / CyberScreen (CQCS)](https://www.cyberscience.com/what-is-cyberquery/) - building Business Intelligence & database solutions

### Commodore Amiga 500, 600, 1200, 1500 (1987)

Another ground-breaking computer, the Amiga 500 was by far the best Christmas present I ever had.  I subseqently purchased 3 further models below.  This was the first computer I used which had a 'windows' system.   The graphics & sound were game changing.
