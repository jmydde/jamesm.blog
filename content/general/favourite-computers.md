## Commodore PET (1977)
The [Commodore PET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PET/) was the first computer I learnt BASIC in the school computing club (1981)

The first program I wrote was an animated Christmas card as part of a  school competition, I was quite proud of it.  We were meant to showcase all of our programs at a public school event however I forgot to take the tape with me to school, I was truly gutted.   I also mislaid the tape at home so have lost all those initial programs I wrote :(

## Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48k (1982)
The [Spectrum 48k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum) was my very first home computer and therefore was very special to me.  It had a unique rubber keyboard.  I used to spend hours on it writing BASIC programs & playing games.

## Data General MV/15000 (1986)
As part of my first job as a computer operator (1992) I was responsible for operating the [Data General](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_General/) **MV/15000** mainframe computer & writing automation scripts.  This has been one of my favourite jobs over the years as I had a lot of responsbility and had to do a lot of problem solving late into the evening, I learnt a lot.   We didn't have the internet or up-to-date manuals back then :)
