## About
OpenAI's Voice Engine is a text-to-speech tool which can create realistic voices from just a 15-second audio sample.  It is notable that a small model with a single 15-second sample can create emotive and realistic voices.  To ensure responsible use testers must get clear consent from voice providers, avoid creating user-generated voices, and inform listeners that the voices are AI-generated.
