## Overview
Wow, crazy times, **the best technology in the world is now becoming incredibly cheap and accessible to everyone!** ðŸ¤¯

**DeepSeek**'s AI chatbot has become the **top free app on Apple's store** since its January launch. This rapid success, fuelled by DeepSeek's **cost-effectiveness** compared to US competitors, has sent shockwaves through financial markets.

Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen has lauded DeepSeek's AI as a "**groundbreaking achievement**", while the company claims it's models rival industry leaders like ChatGPT at a **fraction of the cost**. DeepSeek reportedly invested **only $6 million** in its development, a stark contrast to the **billions spent by US AI companies**.
