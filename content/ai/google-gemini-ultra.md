## About
Google Gemini Ultra is the top-of-the-line offering within the Gemini family of large language models, developed by Google DeepMind [1]. It stands out for its superior capabilities compared to the base Gemini and the advanced version [2]. Here's what makes it special:

**Unmatched Performance**
- State-of-the-Art: Outperforms previous models on various benchmarks, including tasks related to text, code, and more [3].
- MMLU Champion: Achieves a score of 90.0% on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark, surpassing human experts for the first time [2]. MMLU tests a broad range of subjects, demanding both knowledge and problem-solving skills.

**Advanced Features**
- While specific details about its functionalities are likely still under development, we can expect it to possess all the strengths of Gemini Advanced, including:
  - Multimodal reasoning for analyzing combined text and visual information.
  - Expertise in coding, understanding, explaining, and generating code across various languages.
  - Enhanced creative capabilities to brainstorm ideas and craft diverse digital content formats.
- On top of these, Gemini Ultra might offer even more advanced features that haven't been publicly revealed yet.

**Availability**
- Unlike the base Gemini and the mobile-accessible Gemini Advanced (part of Google One AI Premium), Gemini Ultra is likely not widely available yet. It might be in a limited access or beta phase initially [4, 6].

Google Gemini Ultra is a cutting-edge AI model pushing the boundaries of language understanding and generation. Its capabilities are expected to be significant for various fields,  but its accessibility might be limited for now.
