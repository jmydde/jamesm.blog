## About
Geoffrey Hinton is a big name in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly when it comes to  artificial neural networks. He's a British-Canadian computer scientist and cognitive psychologist who's achieved some major milestones:
- **Pioneering Deep Learning**: Hinton's research helped lay the groundwork for the resurgence of deep learning, a powerful technique that enables computers to learn from vast amounts of data. This has led to advancements in areas like image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing.
- **Backpropagation Advocate**: He was instrumental in reviving the idea of backpropagation, a learning algorithm that allows neural networks to adjust and improve their performance.
- **Academia and Industry**: Hinton spent time at both the University of Toronto and Google (until 2023), where he co-founded the Vector Institute in Toronto and worked on Google Brain, a deep learning research team.
- **Awards and Recognition**: His contributions have been widely recognized. He's a recipient of the prestigious Turing Award, often called the "Nobel Prize of computing," among many other accolades.
